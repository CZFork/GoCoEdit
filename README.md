GoCoEditServer-Connector
==============

PHP version of the GoCoEdit Server-Connector. 
It connects the app with your own Http-Server used 
for the ftp part. 

**This is an optional Add-On for the iOS App, only for an edge case use to connect to a FTP-Server over port 80. The GoCoEdit App can connect by default to serval Servers (FTP, SFTP, DROPBOX, GOOGLE DRIVE) without this connector**

All Server connections are stored in your App 
(temporary on your own server only if you use this connector).
